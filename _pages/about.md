Hello - welcome to my website.

I am an Assistant Professor (non-tenure track) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t (LMU) in Munich. I am a member (alumni) of the CESifo network and the collaborative research center TRR 190 (as well as the Fulbright Commission, the Joachim-Herz-Stiftung, the Elite Network of Bavaria, and the excellence programme LMUMentoring). During my PhD I visited the Broom Center at UCSB. 

My research interests focus on health Economics, education Economics, and applied microeconometrics.

You can contact me at ilka.gerhardts[at]econ.lmu.de.
