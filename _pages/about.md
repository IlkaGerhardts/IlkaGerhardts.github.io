Hello - welcome to my website.

I am an Assistant Professor (non-tenure track) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t (LMU) in Munich and a member of the CESifo network and the collaborative research center TRR 190. I am a former fellow of the Fulbright Commission, the Joachim-Herz-Stiftung, the Elite Network of Bavaria, and the excellence programme LMUMentoring. During my PhD I visited the Broom Center at UCSB. 

My research interests focus on health economics, education economics, and applied microeconometrics. 

You can contact me at ilka.gerhardts[at]econ.lmu.de.
